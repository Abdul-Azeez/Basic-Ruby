Integers within a certain range (normally -2 ...2 -1 or -2 ...2 -1) are held internally in
binary form and are objects of class Fixnum . Integers outside this range are stored in objects
of class Bignum
underscore is neglected.
Ruby includes support for rational and complex numbers. You can do Rational(3,4) * Rational(2,3).
The division of integer gives intergers. If you don't want it to give interger then use 
require 'mathn
'
Looping using Numbers
3.times, upto(5), downto(95), step(80,5)
Interpolation allows code to appear within a string. The result of evaluating that code is inserted into the string.
"1+2 =#{1+2}" 
Character Constants. Constants can be created by precedding the character (or sequence that represents a character) with a question mark. 
Ruby range is that it must respond to succ by returning the next object in squences and the objects must be comparable using <=>. This is somethimes call the spaceship operator.

a <=> b :=
  if a < b then return -1
  if a = b then return  0
  if a > b then return  1
  if a and b are not comparable then return nil

Explanation of ATTibrute raders: 
attr_writer : age is the same as 
  def age = (value)
    @age = value
  end

attr_reader : age is same as 
def age 
@age
end

attr_accessor : age 
  def age = (value)
  @age = value
  end
  def age
    @age
  end.

  A character class is a set of characters between brackets:
