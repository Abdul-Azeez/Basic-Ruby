/y/.match('haystack')
pattern matching can be equalize using =~ ie =~ is same as .match
(?:..) construct provides grouping without capturing . That is, it combines the ternms it contains in to an atomic whole without creating a backrefrences.
Alternation. The vertical bar metacharacter(|) combines two experssions into a single one that matches either of the experssions.
The purpose is to specify characters patterns that subsequently are determined to match(or not to match) strings.


Zero-width means it doesn’t consume any characters in the string. The presence
of the period is noted, but you can still match the period if your pattern contin-
ues.
Positive means you want to stipulate that the period be present. There are also
negative lookaheads; they use (?!...) rather than (?=...) .
Lookahead assertion means you want to know that you’re specifying what would be
next, without matching it.
